== Research Experience

=== [project.html The Memory of Power-law Series]
~~~
{}{table}{CVTable}
*Dates*  | Aug 2012 -- Present ||
* Advisor * | Prof. Tao Zhou ||
* Institution* | Web Sciences Center, School of Computer Science and Engineering, UESTC, Chengdu ||
* Main idea* | Power-law distribution emerges in empirical data from human activities and complex systems. We study whether power-law naturally imposes a constraint on the memory (first-order autocorrelation) of random series and the generation of power-law series with specified memory. ||
* My Contributions * |
- Derived analytically the bounds for memory of permuted i.i.d. power-law sequence.
- Validated theoretical results with numerical simulations.
- Designed a simple algorithm for tuning the memory by iterative rearrangement.
~~~

* Advisor * | [http://power.itp.ac.cn/~zhouhj/index.html Prof. Haijun Zhou] ||
* Institution* | Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing ||
* My Contributions * |
- Implemented the algorithm for learning interactions by maximizing pseudolikelihood.
- Evaluated the algorithm by feeding samples from Monte Carlo simulation with different sizes and temperatures.

=== [project.html Predicting link directions via a recursive subgraph-based ranking]
~~~
{}{table}{CVTable}
*Dates*  |Feb 2012 -- June 2012 ||
* Collaborator * | Prof. Tao Zhou (/advisor/) and Zimo Yang ||
* Institution* | Web Sciences Center, School of Computer Science and Engineering, UESTC, Chengdu ||
* Main idea* | For incomplete directed networks, ranking is applied to the problem of predicting link directions by using other links. We propose a solution by first ranking nodes in a specific order and then predicting these links as stemming from a lower-ranked node towards a higher-ranked one. The proposed ranking method works recursively by utilizing local indicators on multiple scales, each corresponding to a subgraph extracted from the original network. ||
* Preprint * | [http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2199 /Predicting link directions via a recursive subgraph-based ranking/] (submitted to /Physica A/) ||
* My Contributions * |
- Collaborated with coauthors to develop the ranking algorithm.
- Analyzed the performance of the algorithm with empirical data.
