== Short Bio

I am a final-year undergraduate student in computer science, studying in Yingcai Experimental School, 
University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. Before that, I attended Chengdu No. 7 High School. I am now *looking for a graduate school to continue my research in computer science*.

While being a CS major, statistical physics has been my long-time fascination. I am interested in research that explores the deep connections between machine learning and statistical physics. 

I also study social networks and human activities with computational methods, under advisory of Prof. Tao Zhou. I enjoy working with my advisor and lab-mates on human-related academic topics, including ranking algorithms, temporal networks models and statistical properties of human behaviors. With two teammates, I was awarded the "Outstanding Winner" in this year's MCM\/ICM for a challenge on inferring criminals in social networks.



== What's new

- \[2013\/01\]~~~I made a presentation titled [talks/BurstMemSlides.pdf ``Memory in Bursty Systems''] at a winter school held at UESTC and discussed relevant problems with [http://statphys.skku.ac.kr/ /Prof. Beom Jun Kim/] from [http://www.skku.edu/eng/ Sungkyunkwan University], Korea.

- \[2013\/01\]~~~[powermemproject.html New updates] on my project investigating the relation between memory (autocorrelation) and power-law.

- \[2012\/12\]~~~I am now a Research Assistant /visiting/ at [http://weblab.com.cityu.edu.hk/blog/ *Web Mining Lab*], [http://www.cityu.edu.hk/ *City University of Hong Kong*]. I will be working in CityU from Dec 2012 to Feb 2013. I plan to study the structural evolution of social networks under advisory of [http://weblab.com.cityu.edu.hk/blog/jzhu/ Professor Jonathan Zhu].

- \[2012\/12\]~~~I feel honored to be awarded as one of the *Outstanding Students* in my university, the highest honor for UESTC graduates. (10 out of 4,500 undergraduates in 09')

- \[2012\/12\]~~~I have just found (with glad surprise) that [http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2199 my paper on ranking and direction] has been cited and used by [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~sucheta/papers/LinkDirections.pdf /Sucheta Soundarajan/ and /Prof. John E. Hopcroft/] at Cornell CS.

- \[2012\/11\]~~~I am currently working on the project of *the memory of power-law random series*, 
see [project.html my projects] for more information.


== Research Interests
- *Machine Learning*,
- and its connection with *Statistical Physics* (e.g. Monte Carlo, Belief Propagation).
- Structure, function and evolution of *Social Networks*.
- Dynamics and statistical properties of *Complex Systems*.
