== [powermemproject.html Power-law Constrains Memory?]
/In collaboration with Prof. Tao Zhou/

{}{img_left}{projects/powerlaw-normal-uni.png}{Power-law, normal and uniform}{440}{}{}
For a time series $\{ T_1,T_2,\cdots,T_n \}$, 
*memory* is defined as the first-order autocorrelation of the sequence \[[http://iopscience.iop.org/0295-5075/81/4/48002 Goh and Barab√°si 2008]\], i.e.
\(
M = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{(T_i -m_1)(T_{i+1} - m_2)}{\sigma_1 \sigma_2},
\)
for describing the short-range temporal correlation of activities.

*Power-law distribution* is ubiquitous in data from traffic, social networks and other human activities. Specifically, most of the inter-event time series from such real systems are found to be power-law distributed and meanwhile positively autocorrelated *(positive memory)*. 

In this study, we analyze the hidden relation between memory and power-law distribution. We want to know whether such a positive bias in memory is due to the constraints imposed by the power-law marginal.

Given a sequence, its memory can be tuned by rearranging the order of the elements, 
while preserving their values. We recently found, both theoretically and experimentally, 
for such a family of random series, 
*power-law imposes a non-trivial constraint on the possible memory of the sequence*, 
which differs markedly from Gaussian and uniform distributions.
~~~

Furthermore, we are studying:
- how power-law marginal constrains the memory of sequence
- analytical expressions for the bounds on memory as a function of scaling exponent
- how to generate random power-law sequence with specified memory (e.g. via Monte Carlo methods)
- how to analyze the asymptotic behavior of diverging statistics with equiprobable-slice approximations
- a better measure of short-range temporal correlations with no distribution-specific bias

== [icm2012.html Finding Conspirators in the Network: Machine Learning with Resource-allocation Dynamics]

A network of communication is embedded into the social relations among
employees in a company, with every edge representing a message sent from one
node to another and categorized by topics. Given a few known criminals,
non-criminals and suspicious topics, then how to estimate the
probability of criminal involvement for those not identified? And, furthermore, how to determine
the leader of conspirators?

We proposed a solution in the framework of machine learning, with carefully selected
features including both topological quantities and semantic similarity measures obtained from 
"resource-allocation" dynamics. For those identified as most probable to be involved in crime, a sensitivity analysis is performed to test the robustness of our method under minor noise. We also used a revised ranking algorithm to find out the leader of the criminal group, which is supported by empirical results from criminology. 

Featured methods\/keywords in our solution:
- Logistic Regression
- Semantic Bipartite Graph
- Resource-allocation Dynamics
- Revised LeaderRank
- Kendall's Tau

== Inverse Ising Problem via Pseudolikelihood Maximization
/Project at 2012 CCAST Summer School on Statistical Physics and Complex Systems/\n
/Advised by [http://power.itp.ac.cn/~zhouhj/index.html Prof. Haijun Zhou] (Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences)/

In Ising model, the Hamiltonian is the sum of contributions from interacting spins and the states are 
distributed in the Boltzmann form, i.e.
\(
P(\bm{\sigma}) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp(-\frac{1}{kT} \sum_{i<j} J_{ij} \sigma_i \sigma_j) \quad \text{(assuming zero external field)}.
\)
The Inverse Ising problem is formulated as: given some observations of states $\bm{\sigma}^{(1)}, \bm{\sigma}^{(2)}, \cdots, \bm{\sigma}^{(M)}$ from the ensemble, then how to recover the interaction coefficients $J_{ij}$?

A straightforward MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimation) is not feasible due to the difficulty for 
computing the partition function $Z = \sum_{\bm{\sigma}} {\exp{(-\frac{1}{kT} \sum_{i<j} J_{ij} \sigma_i \sigma_j)}}$, which 
requires an iteration over all possible states ($O(2^n)$).

However, an approach proposed by \[[http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v108/i9/e090201 Aurell and Ekeberg 2012]\] circumvents this problem by introducing pseudolikelihood, which is the conditional probability of one spin taking +1 given all the others, i.e.
\(
P(\sigma_r = 1 \vert \bm{\sigma}_{/r}) = \frac{P(\sigma_r=1, \bm{\sigma}_{/r})}{P(\sigma_r=1, \bm{\sigma}_{/r})+P(\sigma_r=-1, \bm{\sigma}_{/r})},
\)
which cancels $Z$, involving the neighbors of spin $r$ only.

What I did:
- Implemented the algorithm of pseudolikelihood maximization.
- Analyzed the performance of the algorithm by feeding samples from Monte Carlo simulations with different temperatures and sizes.
- Found that the reconstruction error goes up as $\propto T^2$ when $T>1$.
- Made a [talks/InverseIsingSlides.pdf presentation].

== Predicting link directions via a recursive subgraph-based ranking
/In collaboration with Prof. Tao Zhou (advisor) and Zimo Yang/

~~~

Link directions are essential to the functionality of networks and their prediction is helpful towards a better knowledge of directed networks from incomplete real-world data. We study the problem of predicting the directions of some links by using the existence and directions of the rest of links. 

We propose a solution by first ranking nodes  in a specific order and then predicting each link as stemming from a lower-ranked node towards a higher-ranked one. The proposed ranking method works recursively by utilizing local indicators on multiple scales, each corresponding to a subgraph extracted from the original network. Experiments on real networks show that the directions of a substantial fraction of links can be correctly recovered by our method, which outperforms either purely local or global methods.
